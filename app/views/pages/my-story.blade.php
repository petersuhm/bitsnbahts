<h1>My story</h1>
<p class="lead">
  Tears were literally running down my cheeks for the first time since I was a kid, when I told my parents I wanted to quit my (new) job. How could the "best job ever" make me feel so bad? Why couldn't I just be happy? After all that's what everyone kept telling me to be? I want to tell you my story so far, in order to try to explain why. I'll explain what led to this episode, explain the mistakes I made and continue up until now where I am free as a bird, can work for myself and travel while I do exactly that.
</p>

  I've always been thinking as an entrepreneur. I've always wanted to work for myself and always felt better as the leader of the group (I'm a big brother...). I've always had ideas and projects that I would work on after school. Events, websites etc. Yet, a year after high school, I felt stuck. I was a student at Copenhagen Business School and worked part-time in a bank. I was basically doing what my dad did and it started to freak me out. Well, the entrepreneur inside me was still alive and I still worked on various projects in my free time. One of these projects were a small company I had with a friend that rented out bartenders for weddings, company events etc. It was fun, but had to die due to the workload that school and job required. Being in school and having a good income from the bank felt nice and safe, but... I knew I wanted to work for myself. I knew I had skills good enough to charge money for them, and still, I woke up every morning and went to either the university or my work. Oh, and two more things: At this point in my life I was +100 kilos and smoked at least a pack of cigarettes a day. Something had to happen. The short story: I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357/">the 4-hour work week</a> and dropped out of school. Mom wasn't happy. I was pretty happy. I felt motivated - finally I was gonna change my life for good! Finally I was gonna work for myself and create the life I really wanted. No one could stop me. Throughout the summer, I managed to sort everything out in my head. I registered my small freelance business, bought a ton of training equipment, including an expensive bike, started working out, quit smoking, eating healthy and got my first few clients (some of them I even worked for without charging just to build a portfolio).

  After a month or so of Wordpress hacking, I was contacted by a brand new startup. "Hey man, do you want to join us and work for free on this cool project?" and I was like "yeah, why not!". So that happened. The founders where talented entrepreneurs with many years of experience and I was actually feeling thankful for beeing a part of that project, even though I worked for free (in the beginning). I learned so much about the startup world that would have been very difficult to figure out on my own, and I got to know a lot of interesting people - I don't regret a single hour I put in that project, even though I could have wished for a better ending. I was involved for about 1.5 year - on and off.

<h2>The best job ever</h2>

<p class="lead">
  I was vacationing in a beach house that my parents had rented for a week and I brought a book about Ruby on Rails (a framework for building websites). I was trying my best to learn this, to me, new technology, and was really excited. Actually I was so excited that when one of the guru's I was following on Twitter tweeted a job opening the place he worked, I applied right away. On that day I had known Ruby on Rails for exactly 14 days, but figured why not try. 2 hours later, I recieved a phone call from the project manager at that company and he told me they were interested in meeting me, ASAP. The day I got back to Copenhagen, a Sunday, I went to their office and met him and the owner of the company. It went really well, and when I was on my way back home after the meeting, the owner called me and asked if I could start the next morning. What!? They were having a seminar and he really wanted me to be there. And also, he told me to wear nice clothes since we were going to a nice yacht club for dinner! Everything went so fast and all over sudden I had a job. A job that paid me more than any other of my friends were paid - good wage, nice computer, and some serious bonuses in the pipeline if I did well. Add to that, that my co-workers were the most talented Rails people in Denmark - I had direct access to the gurus on a daily basis! It really was a great job and everyone kept reminding me about that. But what had happened? I quit school to work for myself and all over sudden, from one day to another, I was trapped in the 9-5 trap. My biggest fear. Had I made a mistake? This thought hit me after a few weeks. I tried to suppress it - after all I just got the job...
</p>

<p class="lead">
  I started feeling really bad, but how could I tell anyone? I was successful. How could someone possible understand how I felt. One day, a colleague of mine was fired and I thought to myself: "I wish they would fire me!". Seriously! From that second I decided I had to do something about it. At that time, I'd been working there for about 3 months, and I had to admit that I made a mistake. I had to quit my job.
</p>

<p class="lead">
  When I told my parents about my decision, I got so overwhelmed that I actually cried. It was a mix of relief and shame. Mainly relief. I still had no idea what I would do after - but I knew I had to quit. Now I just had to tell my boss, which I did the day after. I will never forgot what he told me, because it meant so much to me. I respect him a lot and he's a very successful business man that have done really well. He told me: "I knew this day would come, but honestly I thought it would be after a year and not already". He told me that he was confused from the very beginning, because he saw me as the entrepreneurial type and not the typical programmer. Actually, he had planned to give me my own projects that I could run completely on my own, to avoid this exact situation. He tried to convince me to stay and gave me a week off to consider it again. I was sure though. I'd made a mistake and had to bail out. He told me that if I ever had a good idea we could partner up - I could run the business and he could be the investor. I could always call him. He even offered me to bootstrap a business in their offices, so it would be easier to start out. I was blowned away, but felt even more sure about my decision. Even my boss could see it. I promised myself to never make that mistake again - I learned the lesson.

<h2>Back in school with a hidden agenda</h2>

<p class="lead">
  I had a week of and, as far as I was concernedd, had to figure out what to do with my life in that time. What were my options? I didn't have any business ideas in mind and honestly didn't feel like commiting myself to anything at that time! I wanted to travel, but had really no ideas for funding. One day, I took a long ride on my bike and a plan formed itself in my mind: Being Danish, I have access to free education (worldwide) and even gets paid actual money by the Danish government to go to school. What if I dropped back in to school? I was two years away from my bachelor's degree and after only one year I could go on exchange, which meant half a year of traveling. Not to bad! After exchange I only had to spend a semester writing my thesis and then I had my degree. And, of course, plenty of time to figure out what to do with my life.
</p>

<p class="lead">
  I said good bye to work and hello to school. The year passed by quickly and I spent the time preparing for my exchange semester and did a little freelance work as well. I also got the change to visit Sri Lanka, which really gave nutrition to the travel bug within me. Finally, I applied to go to Morocco and was approved. All over sudden I felt super happy. I was on the right track.

  A lot of things happened in that period of my life. I think I grew up a lot. I started exercising a lot more and got really excited about the paleo diet. I started a website about it with a friend, which got quite popular. We shared recepies and ran cases etc. A lot of fun! That winter I ended up 30 kg lighter than I was back when I quited school (I added back some of it later, which I think is fine). It gave me a lot of confidence in myself, confidence that makes life a lot easier when you travel and run your own business. I even inspired and helped other people to lose weight!
</p>

<p class="lead">
  I went abroad and had the most amazing 5 months in Morocco (I was back again this summer to visit friends). The experience assured me of two very important things: 1. I had to do more traveling and 2. I can work from abroad. While I was there, I was still able to Skype with clients and I still got job offers etc. I needed to figure out a way to travel more! When I got back, my first intention was to just buy a ticket to Africa or Asia, which would leave me with half a year to save up money and plan everything out, while I wrote my thesis. Before that happened, though, a friend of mine told me that she was going to Asia for her masters, since the Danish government allows you to bring the money abroad for up to two years. I was like "can I join you?" and she was like "of course man!". All over sudden, I had a plan for the next 2 years of my life, and they even involved traveling. I couldn't believe it.

<h2>Life sorting out itself</h2>

<p class="lead">
  After a ton of research, we found a beautiful university in Chiang Rai, Thailand. We had a lot of bureacracy to work our way through, but finally, after a couple of months, we had the neccessary approvals needed for our stay abroad.
</p>

<p class="lead">
  Life has a way of sorting itself out - especially when you don't expect it. In between all the bureacracy work, I had received quite a few work offers in my freelance business. To be honest, I've been really pro active the last few years, which started to pay of. I had been working for free, working on open source software projects and focused on buidling my skills and resume. Now people wanted to hire me to build stuff - stuff that I actually found really interesting and loved working on (well, most of it...). And the best part of it, I was working for myself this time. Different kinds of opportunies started to show up, including coding, writing etc., and I really try not to put all eggs in one basket now. After some time I started to realise what had happened. I had options! I was building a location independent business that I could bring along on my travels!
</p>

<p class="lead">
  That's pretty much where I am now. I'm not sure any longer if I'm gonna do a masters. I'll give it at least a year and then we'll see. Now, it's all about traveling and seeing the world. Current status: In less than a month, I'm flying to Thailand on a one-way ticket. All my clients know I'm going and most of them are fine with it. I don't have commitments in Denmark, except friends and family. The plan is to travel, enjoy life and bootstrap my "business".
