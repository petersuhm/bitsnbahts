I just got back after picking up my passport at the Thai embassy in Copenhagen, and guess what! Inside it was my tourist visa with 3 entries! This means that I can enter Thailand 3 times over the course of the next 6 months and stay for 60 days each time. Each of these stays can potentially be extended for 30 days as far as I have understood - I guess I'll figure that out when/it becomes relevant.
